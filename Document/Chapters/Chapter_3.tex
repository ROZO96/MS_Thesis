This section should be written in standard scientific
language. Standard techniques in your research field should not be
written out in detail. In computational projects this section should
be used to explain the algorithms used and the layout of the
computational code. A copy of the actual code may be given in the
appendices if appropriate.

This section should emphasise the philosophy of the approach used and
detail novel techniques. However please note: this section should not
be a blow-by-blow account of what you did throughout the project. It
should not contain large detailed sections about things you tried and
found to be completely wrong! However, if you find that a technique
that was expected to work failed, that is a valid result and should be
included.


Here logical structure is particularly important, and you may find
that to maintain good structure you may have to present the
explorations/calculations/computations/whatever in a different order
from the one in which you carried them out.
